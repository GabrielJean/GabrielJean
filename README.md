### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
I am an Cloud/DevOps guy based in Quebec Canada.

I love infrastructure and automation. So with no surprises, my focus is primarily around Devops and Cloud stuff.
I am always looking for the next shiny tech to learn and I hope you will find something useful on my profile.


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Automating my HomeLab
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Azure 
 - ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Docker stuff
 - ðŸ“« How to reach me: *Insert unfinished portfolio here* 
 - âš¡ Fun fact: This is an hidden feature on GitHub
 
Feel free to contribute.

Thanks
